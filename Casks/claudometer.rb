  caveats <<~EOS
    Claudometer reads your local Claude Code credentials and shows usage in the
    macOS menu bar. Requires a Claude Pro/Max/Team subscription signed into Claude Code.

    This is an unsigned build: on first launch macOS may block it. Right-click the
    app and choose "Open", or allow it in System Settings > Privacy & Security.
